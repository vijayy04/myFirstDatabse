Q. how to upload file in github?
Ans. first you need to make a clone of repo. so open cmd and change the directory where you want to make the clone and go to github
and make new clone and copy his path and back again to cmd and type git clone and paste the path and then the clone is done and save the file from in it. 
and now you want to upload the file into the github. so go to the cmd and type git add and file name which you want to upload it.
and if you want to not upload some file then you make a new file .gitignore and type there path file which you wont to upload it.
and if you want to remove the file from git then go to cmd and type `git rm -r <filename>`. Now you save the file in local but now you want to upload file online in github so first go to cmd and type `git push origin <branchName>`. and then pass the commit and also commit is important to make so type `git commit -m '<pass message>'`
```
